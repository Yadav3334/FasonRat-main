<summary>🚀 Getting Started</summary>

### Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Server** | Node.js 22+, npm, Java 17 JRE (for APK builder) |
| **Android** | minSdk 29 (Android 10), targetSdk 35, Java 17 |

### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahimahamed1/FasonRat.git
cd FasonRat
cp .env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env before starting.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

### CLI Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahimahamed1/FasonRat.git
cd FasonRat
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run build
npm start
```

Access dashboard at `http://localhost:32766`

> 🔐 **Default Credentials:** Username: `admin` / Password: `admin`. Change this immediately after first login.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev:backend    # Hot-reload via tsx watch
npm run dev:frontend   # Vite dev server with HMR
npm run dev            # Start both concurrently
```

### Build APK

**Option A: Web Builder (Recommended)**
1. Open dashboard → **Builder**
2. Enter server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:32766`)
3. Set custom app name, icon, and home page URL
4. Click **Build APK** → Download signed `Fason.apk`

Each APK build has its own one-time bootstrap token and can enroll one device.
Build a new APK for each additional device.

**Option B: Gradle (development base APK only)**
```bash
cd fason
./gradlew assembleDebug    # Debug build (~6.4 MB, ARM-only)
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Release build (requires keystore env vars)
```

Direct Gradle output intentionally has no usable bootstrap token. Use the Web
Builder to create an APK that can enroll with the backend.

<summary>⚙️ Configuration</summary>

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `32766` | Server listen port |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Node.js environment |
| `JWT_SECRET` | auto-generated UUID | JWT signing secret |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level |

### Database

SQLite via `better-sqlite3` with Drizzle ORM. Auto-created at `backend/data/fasonrat.db` on first run.

```bash
npm run db:generate   # Generate migration SQL
npm run db:migrate    # Run migrations
npm run db:push       # Push schema directly
npm run db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio
```

### Remote Desktop over the Internet

Remote Desktop uses WebRTC P2P first and Coturn when NAT/firewall traversal
requires a relay. Set the public TURN address in `docker/.env`:

The Android client reports the real display dimensions and rotation over the
WebRTC data channel, so the panel maps pointer coordinates back to device
pixels. Touch, swipe and drag gestures are dispatched through the Android
Accessibility service; the side toolbar provides volume, Home, Recents and
Back actions.

```env
TURN_HOST=turn.example.com
TURN_PORT=3478
TURN_EXTERNAL_IP=203.0.113.10
TURN_REALM=fason.example
TURN_SECRET=a-different-long-random-turn-secret
```

Expose TCP/UDP `TURN_PORT` (3478 by default) and UDP 49152-65535 on the host
firewall. `TURN_EXTERNAL_IP` is the public relay IP; on a server behind 1:1
NAT, set it to `PUBLIC_IP/PRIVATE_IP`. The supplied
Coturn Compose service uses host networking and is intended for Linux hosts.
Serve the dashboard/backend through HTTPS. After the first approval, Fason
keeps that MediaProjection session in a foreground service, so the dashboard
can disconnect and reconnect without another prompt. Android requires approval
again after the user/system stops projection, the screen is locked, the app is
force-stopped or the device reboots; a stopped Android 14+ projection token
cannot legally or technically be reused.

#### Production Remote Desktop checklist

- Put the dashboard/backend behind a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy and forward
  WebSocket upgrade headers. APK server URLs must use that same public
  `https://` origin so Socket.IO uses WSS.
- Set a real public `TURN_HOST`, a unique `TURN_SECRET` of at least 32 random
  characters, and the correct `TURN_EXTERNAL_IP`. The secret must match
  Coturn's `--static-auth-secret` value.
- Open TCP/UDP 3478 (or your configured `TURN_PORT`) and UDP 49152-65535.
  Networks that block non-TLS TURN may additionally require TURN/TLS on 5349
  or 443 with a trusted certificate.
- On Android, grant notification permission, approve MediaProjection, and
  enable `RemoteControlService` in Accessibility settings.
- Verify from two genuinely different networks. The panel should report
  `TURN connected` when a relay candidate is selected; a configured URL alone
  does not prove that the relay is reachable.

### Device Enrollment and Credentials

The APK Builder creates a random bootstrap token for each build and stores only
its SHA-256 hash as `pending`. On first launch, the APK sends that token and its
`ANDROID_ID` to `/api/device/enroll` over HTTPS. The token is bound to the first
device that uses it, and becomes consumed when that device authenticates its
Socket.IO connection.

The backend returns a separate random device credential and stores only its
hash. Android encrypts the credential with a non-exportable Android Keystore
key. The bootstrap token is never written to app storage and is cleared from
process memory after enrollment; the embedded copy in the signed APK becomes
useless after the server consumes it. Use the key and shield controls on a
device page to rotate or revoke that device only. `JWT_SECRET` and `TURN_SECRET`
remain independent and unchanged.

APKs built with the previous shared `DEVICE_SECRET` mechanism cannot authenticate
after this upgrade. Build a new APK from the panel and update/reinstall it on
each managed device.
